# ng Chuck Norris Jokes

[DEMO LINK](https://sofiiaasieieva.github.io/ng-find-jokes/)

## Description

The main function of this app is to find jokes about Chuck Norris.

In this application, a request is made to the server https://api.chucknorris.io/

Data in the object format is pulled from this request.

By going to the ff-test-page tab you can find jokes about Chuck Norris.
In a text search engine, you can enter any word you are interested in and click the "Find!" Button.
The server will return all matching requests to you.

You can also enter "random", and you will get the first twelve random jokes.

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repository

2. Go to project folder and install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Launch development server, and open `localhost:4200` in your browser:

```
npm start
```

4. Login to the system

```
login: 1

```

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.
You should not use `ng serve` directly, as it does not use the backend proxy configuration by default.
